# Advanced Usage

```bash
dotload @<username> <branch_name>
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: You can also use `-b` or `--branch` flags:

```bash
dotload @<username> -b <branch_name>
# Or
dotload @<username> --branch <branch_name>
```

Where `branch_name` is the branch of the repository you want to clone. If not specified, the default branch is used.

This can be useful if you have multiple machine usage scenarios

man dotload
```
