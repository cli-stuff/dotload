## ü§î How it Works

`dotload` works by cloning your specified dotfiles repository from **GitHub**. It was created to simplify the installation of dotfiles, necessary development tools (such as nodejs, php, etc.), and other packages as much as possible.

Before using dotload, you need to create your own repository named "`dotfiles`" on GitHub. This repository should contain your dotfiles and any other configuration files that you want to clone to your new machine.

The script is invoked with the GitHub username whose dotfiles you want to clone. You can also specify a branch name if you want to clone a specific branch.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can install `dotload` using the following command:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:salumin/tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dotload
```

Or you can run without installation on **any** OS with this command:

```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/okineadev/dotload/releases/latest/download/dotload | bash
```

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
dotload @<username>
```

Where `username` is the **GitHub username** whose dotfiles you want to clone.

### Advanced Usage

```bash
dotload @<username> <branch_name>
```

You can also use `-b` or `--branch` flags:

```bash
dotload @<username> -b <branch_name>
# Or
dotload @<username> --branch <branch_name>
```

Where `branch_name` is the branch of the repository you want to clone. If not specified, the default branch is used.
