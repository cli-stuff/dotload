## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the project

![Screenshot](public/screenshot.png)

`dotload` works by cloning the specified user's **GitHub** dotfiles repository

This tool was created to make it as **easy as possible** to install dotfiles, required development tools (such as **nodejs**, **php**, **etc**.) and other packages.

### ü§î How does it work?
This tool makes symbolic links to your dotfiles from `~/.dotload` to `$HOME` directory

It can also make symbolic links to folders (including subfolders) whose name starts with a dot, for example `.configs`

> [!WARNING]
> Dotfiles with identical names will be inevitably overwritten with new ones from your repository!

For example, if you have a file `~/.bashrc` on your computer and in the repository, it will be overwritten with a new one from the repository, before cloning them, make sure that they are yours or you have made a backup of previous configurations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can install `dotload` using the following package managers:

<details>
  <summary><b>apt (PPA) (Reccomended) ‚úÖ</b></summary>
  <br/>

  You will also receive further updates with this method

  ```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:salumin/tools
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install dotload
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>With install.sh</b></summary>
  <br/>

  With this method, you can install dotload on almost **any system**, including Termux

  üì• **Install**:

  ```bash
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okineadev/dotload/main/install.sh | bash
  ```

  üóëÔ∏è **Uninstall**:

  ```bash
  sudo rm $PREFIX/bin/dotload && hash -r
  ```

  > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: If you want to remove this tool from **Termux**, you need to run the above command without `sudo`

</details>

<!-- Temporary closed because useless -->
<!-- <details>
  <summary><b>Snap ‚ö†Ô∏è</b></summary>
  <br/>

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: The **snap** version of the package may not work with custom installation scripts

  ```bash
  curl -LO https://github.com/okineadev/dotload/releases/download/v1.1.0/dotload_1.1.0_all.snap
  sudo snap install dotload_1.1.0_all.snap --dangerous
  ```

  This snap pack is for gourmets only :)

  I do not recommend using it

</details> -->

Or you can run without installation on **any** OS with this command:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://github.com/okineadev/dotload/releases/latest/download/dotload) @username
```

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
dotload @username
dotload https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git
```

Where `username` is the **GitHub username** whose dotfiles you want to clone.

You can also use URLs of repositories such as **GitLab**, **Codeberg**, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> The username cannot contain emojis, spaces or other non-standard characters

### Advanced Usage

```bash
dotload @username branch_name
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also use `-b` or `--branch` flags:

```bash
dotload @<username> [--branch branch_name | -b branch_name]
dotload <repo_url> [--branch branch_name | -b branch_name]
```

Where `branch_name` is the branch of the repository you want to clone. If not specified, the default branch is used. This can be useful if you have multiple machine usage scenarios

---

Use the `--help` flag to get help:

```bash
dotload --help
# Help page...
```

There is also support for `manpages`:

```bash
man dotload
```

### Custom installation scripts

You can also add an installation script to your `dotfiles` repository to fully automate the installation and get more features

The installation file can have the following names and locations:

- _install.sh_
- _install_
- _bootstrap.sh_
- _bootstrap_
- _script/bootstrap_
- _setup.sh_
- _setup_
- _script/setup_

If none of these files are found, then any files or folders in your selected dotfiles repository starting with `.` are automatically symlinked to the `$HOME` directory.

### Configuration

You can also **specify a custom installation script**
or make it optional in `dotload.conf`, for this read the [**dotload.conf documentation**](docs/dotload_conf.md)
