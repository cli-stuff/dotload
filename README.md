`dotload` works by cloning the specified user's **GitHub** dotfiles repository

This tool was created to make it as **easy as possible** to install dotfiles, required development tools (such as **nodejs**, **php**, **etc**.) and other packages.

### ü§î How does it work?

This tool makes symbolic links to your dotfiles from `~/.dotload` to `$HOME` directory

It can also make symbolic links to folders (including subfolders) whose name starts with a dot, for example `.configs`

> [!WARNING]
> Dotfiles with identical names will be inevitably overwritten with new ones from your repository!

For example, if you have a file `~/.bashrc` on your computer and in the repository, it will be overwritten with a new one from the repository, before cloning them, make sure that they are yours or you have made a backup of previous configurations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can install `dotload` using the following package managers:

<details>
  <summary><b>Homebrew</b></summary>
  <br/>

  With [**brew**](https://brew.sh/) you can install this tool on **macOS** (and **Linux** too)

  > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: If you don't have [**brew**](https://brew.sh/) installed, install it **now** with this command:

  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

  <hr/>

  üì• **Install**:

  ```bash
  brew tap cli-stuff/dotload
  brew install dotload
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>With install.sh</b></summary>
  <br/>

  With this method, you can install **dotload** on almost **any system**, including **Termux**

  üì• **Install**:

  ```bash
  curl -sL https://cutt.ly/dotload-install | bash
  ```

  üóëÔ∏è **Uninstall**:

  ```bash
  sudo rm $PREFIX/bin/dotload && hash -r
  ```

  > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: If you want to remove this tool from **Termux**, you need to run the above command without `sudo`

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>From sources</b></summary>
  <br/>

  With this method, you can easily modify the installation and be sure of security.

  Steps to install from sources:

  1. Clone the repository

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/cli-stuff/dotload.git
  ```

  2. Go to the project folder

  ```bash
  cd dotload
  ```

  3. Install the tools

  If you don't have `make` installed, you need to install it:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install make
  ```

  There is also support for [**task**](https://taskfile.dev/).

  üì• **Install**:

  ```bash
  make install
  ```

  > üí° Tip: If you prefer to use the more modern [**task**](https://taskfile.dev/) instead of [**GNU make**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), you can use this command:

  ```bash
  task install
  ```

  üóëÔ∏è **Uninstall**:

  ```bash
  make uninstall
  # Or
  task uninstall
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Termux</b></summary>
  <br/>

  You will also receive further updates with this method

  ```bash
  # Add Termux User Repository
  pkg install tur-repo
  pkg update && pkg install dotload
  ```

</details>

Or you can run without installation on **any** OS with this command:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://cutt.ly/dotload) @username
```

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
dotload @username
dotload @username/repo_name
dotload https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git
```

Where `username` is the **GitHub username** whose dotfiles you want to clone.

`repo_name` - Name of your **dotfiles repository**, if not specified - `dotfiles` name will be used by default

You can also use URLs of repositories such as **GitLab**, **Codeberg**, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> The username cannot contain emojis, spaces or other non-standard characters

### Advanced Usage

```bash
dotload @username branch_name
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also use `-b` or `--branch` flags:

```bash
dotload @<username> [--branch branch_name | -b branch_name]
dotload <repo_url> [--branch branch_name | -b branch_name]
```

Where `branch_name` is the branch of the repository you want to clone. If not specified, the default branch is used. This can be useful if you have multiple machine usage scenarios

---

Use the `--help` flag to get help:

```bash
dotload --help
# Help page...
```

### Custom installation scripts

You can also add an installation script to your `dotfiles` repository to fully automate the installation and get more features

The installation file can have the following names and locations:

- _install.sh_
- _install_
- _bootstrap.sh_
- _bootstrap_
- _script/bootstrap_
- _setup.sh_
- _setup_
- _script/setup_

If none of these files are found, then any files or folders in your selected dotfiles repository starting with `.` are automatically symlinked to the `$HOME` directory.

### Configuration

You can also **specify a custom installation script**
or make it optional in `dotload.conf`, for this read the [**dotload.conf documentation**](docs/dotload_conf.md)
